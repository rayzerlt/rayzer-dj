					<p>Rayzer, DJ and producer from Lithuania. Although a little young, he is capable of doing great things in the music industry.</p>
					<p>He started making music in 2021 and immediately signed with the MasterBeat Project. Partnering with MBP, he founded the label Emergence Records.</p>
					<p>Under the Rayzer alias, he makes oldschool hardstyle inspired by Dark Sounds, similar to early hardcore. We can tell that his style has big hard basses, dark sounds and powerful acids.</p>

					<p>As a producer he works in other styles too under other aliases.</p>
					<h3>Mindproject</h3>
					<p>When we hear this name, we can't say this is not an aggressive style. And it's absolutely right. This alias is working with oldschool hardcore. Style from 90's to 2000's, also dark and hard.</p>
					<h3>Trance F-Ect</h3>
					<p>The name of this alias tells the genre. Trance and hardtrance.</p>
					<h3>Dewstate</h3>
					<p>With melodies, but hard anyway. Euphoric hardstyle, rawstyle, UK hardcore, uptempo, frenchcore and GPF style hardcore.</p>
					<p>In the future Rayzer will come with great and more aggressive vibes. He's planning to release his work under good and established labels.</p>
